# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I learned how the module worked mainly through the descriptions provided on the npm site and the README. Then, once knowing the general purpose, I was able to go through the code and see where things got done. A part of the code that made it easy to understand was there were already a few comments in there and there were well worded error messages. Without those, I wouldn't have known what those errors did. I would change some of the naming of variables, as they didn't ully describe what they were containing or doing. 


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Raising the level of abstraction means generalizing the function of the something. For example, if I really wanted to explain what a microwave does, I could talk about the specific wavelength of the waves emitted inside, which vibrate the tiny water molecules to produce heat in the substance. Or, I could simply say, "It heats up your food", which is plenty descriptive for someone who wants to use the microwave for what it was designed for. To write an effective comment, I would tell a CSE142 student to describe the method's purpose for the "end user" in active verb tense. e.g. "The microwave cooks food".


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> It took me about 4 hours to complete this assignment.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Nikki Nikkhoui and Keegan Farley gave me advice on picking an npm module.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> It takes longer to pick a module than you think. The modules out there, especially the small ones, do not have all the same format; people write code differently. At times, it seems difficult to find a module that fits in the parameters of the assignment (not too short, but not too long).
